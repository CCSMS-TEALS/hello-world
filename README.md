# hello-world
Welcome to your first fork!

Try running this on repl.  Once you get the hang of running the code, try editing the `hello-world.py` file.  what happens when you change the name passed to the `say_hello` function on line 10?  what happens if you change the message in the `say_hello` function on line 6?

what on earth do you think is happening in lines 13 and 14?
